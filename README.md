# Tesseract 4 OCR Compilation - Docker Container

This repository contains scripts and definition of Docker container that helps to compile [Tesseract 4](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).
If you are looking for ready to use Teserract 4 Runtime Environment container (and don't want to compile it) please take look at [tesseractshadow/tesseract4re](https://hub.docker.com/r/tesseractshadow/tesseract4re/).

If you are not familiar with Docker please read [Docker - Get Started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).
This compilation procedure is based on:
* [Compilation Guide for Linux](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Compiling#linux)
* and [Building Leptonica Guide](http://www.leptonica.org/source/README.html)

## Compilation
Prerequisites:
* [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
* [Download](https://github.com/tesseract-shadow/tesseract-ocr-compilation/archive/master.zip) and unzip this repository

Scripted steps (tested as a root `sudo su`):
<!-- 1. `./scripts/1-pull-container.sh` - pull **tesseractshadow/tesseract4cmp** image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tesseractshadow/tesseract4cmp/) (automated build using dockerfile from this repository). -->
2. `./scripts/2-remove-container.sh` - (optional) remove **tesseract-ocr** if it already exists and you want to start from begining (note, all compilation results stored inside container will be lost).
3. `./scripts/3-run-new-container.sh` - run the new **tesseract-ocr** container.
4. `./scripts/4-update-src.sh` - update source code of Leptionica and Tesseract.
5. `./scripts/5-compile-src.sh` - compile Leptionica and Tesseract, it may take tens of minutes
6. `./scripts/6-test-ocr.sh` - do some OCR tests
7. `./scripts/7-build-pkg.sh` - (optional) build Leptionica and Tesseract packages and copy them outside **tesseract-ocr** container

## Bulid docker IMAGE yourself

1. Clone this repository
2. Execute `./dockerfile.build.sh`

## Run docker CONTAINER, Build and Test Tesseract
1. Run Container: ./scripts/3-run-new-container.sh
2. Show Tesseract version: ./scripts/8-version-ocr.sh
3. Test Tesseract: ./scripts/6-test-ocr.sh

## If something went wrong
You can get into the container using SSH:
- `localhost:4022`,
- user: `root`,
- [password](https://github.com/tesseract-shadow/tesseract-ocr-compilation/blob/fb93548e4ec756bda3dbc0237f58c23053441953/Dockerfile#L41)
